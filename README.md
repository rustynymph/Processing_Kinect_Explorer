# Kinect Explorer for Processing

This is a [Processing](https://processing.org/) project that interfaces with a Kinect v1 and contains a series of keyboard events that enable/disable different options and methods of Processing's OpenKinect library. 

#### What you need  
*  [Processing](https://processing.org/) (Note: this project has only been built and tested on Processing 3.2.3)
*  A Kinect. 
  *  There are some methods in this project that will only work for Kinect v1, but if you are using v2 it should be easy to change. Check out [http://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/](http://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/) to see the slight differences between the two versions.
